# Poem_Generation
# Transformer-Based Poetry Generator

This project demonstrates the use of transformer models for generating poetry. It leverages state-of-the-art natural language processing techniques to create meaningful and stylistic text outputs.

## Features

- **Transformer Architecture**: Uses transformer-based models like GPT or BERT for text generation.
- **Customizable Outputs**: Generate poems with adjustable lengths, styles, or themes.
- **Interactive Environment**: Implemented in a Jupyter Notebook for ease of experimentation and modification.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Python libraries (see below)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>

### Usage
Open the notebook in Jupyter.
Follow the instructions provided in the notebook to configure and run the poetry generation model.
Adjust parameters such as temperature, length, and seed text to customize the generated poems.

### Dataset
If this project requires a dataset, ensure it is downloaded or linked in the appropriate cell of the notebook.
Example datasets for text generation can include public corpora like Project Gutenberg or Poetry Foundation.

### Model
The project utilizes pre-trained transformer models from libraries such as:
Hugging Face Transformers
OpenAI GPT
Fine-tuning steps are included for domain-specific customization if needed.
  
### Output
Generated poems are displayed directly in the notebook.
Optional: Save outputs to a text file for further analysis or sharing.
